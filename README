# Contains helpful scrpts to manage population data (mostly for plink format)

#Compare.py 

#Compares 2 plink .bim files , --file1 --file2 
#Outputs a "combined.txt" file with all commmon SNPs 

#admixture_plot.py

#creates admxiture plot using an admixture format file and their labels (not created by me)


#keeptransversions.py

#Goes through a .bim file only keeping transversion SNPs and outputs them. (the new file cannot be used with the original bed file!)
#A simple modification will make it work for vcf files 


#positionstors.py

#goes through a .bim file converting all position IDs to rs names using a "support" .bim file to get the rs names corresponding to the positions

#rstopositions.py

#does the reverse thing, all rs names are translated to their chromosome positions(usefull if you want to compare 2 bim files with one lacking rs names)

#removechrom90.py
